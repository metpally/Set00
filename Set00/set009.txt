remainder
---------
Usage: (remainder a b)
Gives the remainder value when a is divided by b

Example: (remainder 6 5) => 1

Modulo
-------
The functioning of remainder is similar to modulo function for positive values, but it differs in case of negative numbers.
The result of modulo is calculated as per the Eucledian division, whereas the result of remainder is calculated using plain division


Usage: (modulo a b)
Gives the modulo value 
Example: (modulo 10 3) => 1
		 (modulo -10.0 3) => 2.0
		 (modulo 10.0 -3) => -2.0
		  modulo -10 -3) => -1
		  
modulo(a, b) (rem((+ b (rem( a, b ))), b))
